# LED Control Circuit

## Project Information
- **Project Number:** 1  
- **Group Number:** 13  
- **Course:** COMP1045 – Internet of Things (Arduino)  
- **Instructor:** Anmar Jarjees  

## Group Members
- Jashanpreet Singh  
- Aryan Katotra  
- Milan Karki  

## Project Description
This project demonstrates a simple LED blinking circuit using an **Arduino Uno**, a **breadboard**, a **resistor**, and an **LED**.  
The LED is connected to **digital pin 13**, which is controlled by the Arduino program written in **C++**.  
When the program runs, the LED repeatedly turns **ON** and **OFF** at regular intervals, showing how digital output works in Arduino.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno R3  
- Breadboard  
- LED (Red)  
- 220Ω Resistor  
- Jumper Wires  

## Circuit Description
- The LED’s **anode (+)** is connected to **Pin 13** through a **220Ω resistor**.  
- The **cathode (–)** is connected to **GND** on the Arduino.  
- When the code runs, the Arduino sends a HIGH signal (5V) from Pin 13, lighting the LED.  
- When it sends a LOW signal, the LED turns off.

## Simulation Platform
The project was designed and tested using **Tinkercad Circuits**.  
Circuit Name: `Project1-Circuit-JashanpreetSingh`

## Code File
- `project1_group13.ino`  
  Contains the Arduino C++ code to control LED blinking.
